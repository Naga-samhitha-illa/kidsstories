<h1>THE CRYSTAL BALL</h1>
<img src="The-Crystal-Ball-story.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
<p id="a"> <font size='15'>Nasir,</font> a small boy, found a crystal ball behind the banyan tree of his garden. The tree told him that it would grant him a wish. He was very happy and he thought hard, but unfortunately, he could not come up with anything he wanted. So, he kept the crystal ball in his bag and waited until he could decide on his wish.</p>
<p>Days went by without him making a wish but his best friend saw him looking at the crystal ball. He stole it from Nasir and showed it to everyone in the village. They all asked for palaces and riches and lots of gold, but could not make more than one wish. In the end, everyone was angry because no one could have everything they wanted. They became very unhappy and decided to ask Nasir for help. Nasir wished that everything would go back to how it was once â€“ before the villagers had tried to satisfy their greed. The palaces and gold vanished and the villagers once again became happy and content.</p>
<h2>Moral of the Story:</h2>
<p id="b">"Money and wealth do not always bring happiness."</p>
